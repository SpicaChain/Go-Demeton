# Go-Demeton 

## Documentation

## Contribution

We are very glad that you are considering to help Demeton Team or go-demeton project, including but not limited to source code, documents or others.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit more complex changes though, please check up with the core devs first on our [slack channel](http://cyber-demeton.herokuapp.com) to ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project and/or get some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as well as our review and merge procedures quick and simple.

Thanks.
